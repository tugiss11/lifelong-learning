# Lifelong learning

Lifelong learning is the "ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated" pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. It is important for an individual's competitiveness and employability, but also enhances social inclusion, active citizenship, and personal development. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning))

## What This is, and Where It comes from

I will use this repository as tool to support my lifelong learning. This way of collecting resources to a repository is heavily inspired by [this tremendous resource](https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing). I used to have all this stuff in my notes but now I want to try out a repository so it's easily shareable and I can see the learning path by just looking at the commit history üòÅ

### Influential books
A collection of my favorite quotes from my favorite books
- [The Toyota Way to Lean Leadership: Achieving and Sustaining Excellence Through Leadership Development](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11722275)
  - _"Long-term philosophy. Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial  goals."_
  - _"The right process will produce the right results. Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.  Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time. Use visual control so no problems are hidden."_
  - _"Add value to the organization by developing your people. Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others. Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy. Teams should consist of 4-5 people. Success is based on the team, not the individual."_
  - _"Continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning. Become a learning organization through relentless reflection (hansei) and continuous improvement (kaizen)."_
- [Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20787425-reinventing-organizations)
  - _"Striving for wholeness: People bring their whole selves to work instead of putting on a professional mask"_
  - _"Information and knowledge are everything in modern organisations"_
  - _"In traditional pyramid structures, people at the bottom tend to feel powerless, resigned and resentful, while those at the top are plagued by stress, politics and mistrust. Modern organizations make everyone more powerful by replacing the pyramid with self-managing teams."_
  - _"Egos are left outside of the organization. Ask yourself, am I serving myself, my career, my team or our common goals?"_
  - _"Direction and vision should come within, not given. Find your intrinsic motivation. Modern organizations are described as living systems that continuously change and adapt."_
- [Coaching for Performance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/949515.Coaching_for_Performance)
  - _‚ÄúCoaching is unlocking people‚Äôs potential to maximize their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them.‚Äù_
  - ‚Äú_The carrot and the stick are prevasive and persuasive motivators. But if you treat people like donkeys, they will perform like donkeys.‚Äù_
  - _"The GROW Model is a coaching framework used in conversations, meetings and everyday leadership to unlock potential and possibilities. GROW was created by Sir John Whitmore and colleagues in the late 1980s. It has since become the world‚Äôs most popular coaching model for problem solving, goal setting and performance improvement."_
- [Black Box Thinking: Why Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes - But Some Do](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611735-black-box-thinking)
  - _‚ÄúIt highlights the need for a growth mindset in life‚Ä¶It advocates for changing attitudes towards failure, and understanding that the only way we learn is by trying things and altering our behaviour based on the results.‚Äù_ Richard Branson, Virgin Group
  - _‚ÄúAn extraordinary, inspirational book which reveals how great performers and teams are driven by an insatiable curiosity for marginal gains, together with the intellectual courage to challenge their most cherished assumptions.‚Äù_ Dave Brailsford, Great Britain Cycling Team
  - _‚ÄúCreative breakthroughs always begin with multiple failures. This brilliant book shows how true invention lies in the understanding and overcoming of these failures, which we must learn to embrace.‚Äù_ James Dyson, Designer, Inventor & Entrepreneur
  - _"The marginal gains approach is not just about mechanistic iteration. You need judgment and creativity to determine how to find solutions to what the data is telling you, but those judgments, in turn, are tested as part of the next optimization loop. Creativity not guided by a feedback mechanism is little more than white noise."_
  - _"This, then, is what we might call ‚Äúblack box thinking.‚Äù* For organizations beyond aviation, it is not about creating a literal black box; rather, it is about the willingness and tenacity to investigate the lessons that often exist when we fail, but which we rarely exploit. It is about creating systems and cultures that enable organizations to learn from errors, rather than being threatened by them."_
- [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)
  - _‚ÄúTruth can only be found in one place: the code.‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúIndeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.‚Äù_
  - _"Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way."_
  - _"Code is clean if it can be understood easily ‚Äì by everyone on the team. Clean code can be read and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. With understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility and maintainability._"
  - _"The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures.‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúIt is a myth that we can get systems ‚Äúright the first time.‚Äù Instead, we should implement only today‚Äôs stories, then refactor and expand the system to implement new stories tomorrow. This is the essence of iterative and incremental agility. Test-driven development, refactoring, and the clean code they produce make this work at the code level.‚Äù_
- [The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project)
  - _"Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúAny improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion.‚Äù_
  - _‚Äú'technical debt' that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts, which may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the compounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization doesn‚Äôt pay down its technical debt, every calorie in the organization can be spent just paying interest, in the form of unplanned work.‚Äù_
  - _‚Äúuntil code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it‚Äôs merely WIP stuck in the system.‚Äù_
  - _"Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system.‚Äù_
- [Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2741559-tribal-leadership)
  - _"Signs of Stage Two. People talk as though they are disconnected from organizational concerns, seeming to not care about what‚Äôs going on. They do the minimum to get by, showing almost no initiative or passion. They cluster together in groups that encourage passive-aggressive behavior (talking about how to get out of work, or how to shine the boss on) while telling people in charge that they are on board with organizational initiatives."_ 
  - _"Signs of Stage Three. People engage in anything that‚Äôs going on, with energy and commitment, but when you listen closely, they talk mostly about themselves and focus on appearing smarter and better than others. They think they‚Äôre focused on team concerns, but their actions show their interest is personal. People tend to form two-person relationships, so if they manage a group of ten, they have ten relationships. They rarely bring people together, they resist sharing information except when it‚Äôs necessary, and they pride themselves on being better informed than others. Winning is all that matters, and winning is personal. People at this stage complain that they don‚Äôt have enough time or support and that the people around them aren‚Äôt as competent or as committed as they are."_
  - _"Signs of Stage Four. Teams are the norm, focused around shared values and a common purpose. Information moves freely throughout the group. People‚Äôs relationships are built on shared values. They tend to ask, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the next right thing to do?‚Äù and to build ad hoc partnerships to accomplish what‚Äôs important at the moment. Their language focuses on ‚Äúwe,‚Äù not ‚Äúme.‚Äù If two people get in a squabble, a third will step in and repair the relationship rather than create a personal following for himself."_
  - _"Stage Four, people assume trust; they don‚Äôt earn it. At Stage Three, trust is earned. When lost, it has to be re-earned. At Stage Four, we observed a different phenomenon: people granted trust from the beginning. In fact, when we tried to set up meetings with people at Stage Three, many rebuffed us because they didn‚Äôt know who we were."_
  - _"Stage Five‚Äôs T-shirt would read ‚Äúlife is great,‚Äù and they haven‚Äôt been doing illicit substances. Their language revolves around infinite potential and how the group is going to make history‚Äînot to beat a competitor, but because doing so will make a global impact. This group‚Äôs mood is ‚Äúinnocent wonderment,‚Äù with people in competition with what‚Äôs possible, not with another tribe._

- [Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22529127-team-of-teams)
  - _‚ÄúOrganizations must be networked, not siloed, in order to succeed.‚Äù_
  - _"Create shared consciousness in your organization by sharing information building genuine relationships and trust. Once you have shared consciousness focus on empowered execution where anyone in the organization can take action without needing approval as long as they provide all contextual information to leaders. Leaders can then take an eyes on hands off approach to management and instead of executing they can focus on fostering an environment conducive to shared consciousness and empowered execution."_
  - _‚ÄúIn popular culture, the term ‚Äúbutterfly effect‚Äù is almost always misused. It has become synonymous with ‚Äúleverage‚Äù‚Äîthe idea of a small thing that has a big impact, with the implication that, like a lever, it can be manipulated to a desired end. This misses the point of Lorenz‚Äôs insight. The reality is that small things in a complex system may have no effect or a massive one, and it is virtually impossible to know which will turn out to be the case.‚Äù_
  - _"The temptation to lead as a chess master, controlling each move of the organization, must give way to an approach as a gardener, enabling rather than directing. A gardening approach to leadership is anything but passive. The leader acts as an ‚ÄúEyes-On, Hands-Off‚Äù enabler who creates and maintains an ecosystem in which the organization operates._
  - _‚ÄúEfficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right thing. Efficiency remains important, but the ability to adapt to complexity and continual change has become an imperative. All the efficiency in the world has no value if it remains static in a volatile world‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúIf I told you that you weren‚Äôt going home until we win‚Äîwhat would you do differently?‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúToday‚Äôs rapidly changing world, marked by increased speed and dense interdependencies, means that organizations everywhere are now facing dizzying challenges, from global terrorism to health epidemics to supply chain disruption to game-changing technologies. These issues can be solved only by creating sustained organizational adaptability through the establishment of a team of teams. Years ago, a Fortune 500 firm was expected to last around seventy-five years. Today this life expectancy is less than fifteen years and is constantly declining.‚Äù_
  
- [Software Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48816586-software-engineering-at-google)
  - _‚ÄúTraditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúProgramming is the immediate act of producing code. Software engineering is the set of policies, practices, and tools that are necessary to make that code useful for as long as it needs to be used and allowing collaboration across a team.‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúKnowledge is in some ways the most important (though intangible) capital of a software engineering organization, and sharing of that knowledge is crucial for making an organization resilient and redundant in the face of change. A culture that promotes open and honest knowledge sharing distributes that knowledge efficiently across the organization and allows that organization to scale over time. In most cases, investments into easier knowledge sharing reap manyfold dividends over the life of a company.‚Äù_
  - _‚ÄúIn a professional software engineering environment, criticism is almost never personal - it‚Äôs usually just part of the process of making a better project. The trick is to make sure you (and those around you) understand the difference between a constructive criticism of someone‚Äôs creative output and a flat-out assault against someone‚Äôs character._
  - _"Software is sustainable when, for the expected life span of the code, we are capable of responding to changes in dependencies, technology, or product requirements. We may choose to not change things, but we need to be capable."_
  - _‚ÄúIf you liked it, you should have put a test on it.‚Äù_
  - _"Previous research (DORA/State of DevOps/Accelerate) has shown that trunk-based development is a predictive factor in high-performing development organizations. Long-lived dev branches are not a good default plan."_
  - _"Velocity is a team sport: The optimal workflow for a large team that develops code collaboratively requires modularity of architecture and near-continuous integration."_
  - _"Faster is safer: Ship early and often and in small batches to reduce the risk of each release and to minimize time to market."_

## List of professional passions
- Agile and lean
  - _"A backlog full of promises is a backlog full of waste. Any promise made on past understanding is likely to be wrong in the light of current understanding."_ [- Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1522975948332621824)
  - _"An Agile way to build: 1) Build the smallest simplest thing that does the work necessary to provide a small bit of value. That rarely requires a database. 2) Incrementally improve that thing. 3) If some improvement would have been easier had there been a database, refactor it in."_ [- Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1519041444773830657)
  - _"How do you decide what to put in a Sprint without estimates? Just pick the most valuable thing and break it into small chunks so that you can identify the less-valuable parts and deliver often. If it's truly valuable, you can't afford not to do it, so estimates are irrelevant._" [- Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1529526688270278656)
  - _"Working at 100% capacity is never a good idea. If local firefighters were putting out fires 100% of the time, you wouldn‚Äôt be very happy when your house caught fire. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve added you to the backlog. We'll be there in a few weeks.‚Äù"_ [- Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1522242045959540736)
  - _"Defects are waste, so if you find one, the kaizen approach is to change your process so that similar defects cannot occur again. The point is to not (just) fix the defect, but to fix the process that allowed the defect to occur in order to prevent future defects from happening."_ [- Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1515558691197517824)

    - _"Are you aiming to build a self-serve data infrastructure as a platform? An automated platform (Infra as a platform) allows the product team to control the lifecycle of data from the hands of a developer at the source to connect the data product and then run the semantic queries at mesh level. The platform provides storage, pipeline, data catalog, and access control to the domains. It reduces any chance of duplication in effort and hence increases the efficiency of data treatment._"
    - _"Do systems/teams see their data as a product? the concerned team sees the data as their product and is responsible for processing the data to be used as a ready-to-use unit."_

- Software engineering and craftsmanship
  - _"The more experienced you get, hopefully the simpler you start to build things. An aspiration should be to write less code and build the least complicated thing to achieve the results and flexibility you need...not write more code faster. That's often just the easy way out."_ [- Nick Craver](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/status/1312541748812423168)
  - _"Very, very often the dumbest possible solution is the quickest possible solution. Don't over-engineer things. Usually you don't need to. And usually you won't get that time back.

  - _"TDD "tests" are not tests. I wish we'd get over that. They are examples of how we want the code we are writing to be used, expressed in a test format so that we can execute them easily. As such, they are executable specifications‚Äîexplaining how the code should work. Not tests."_ [- Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1521957596445306881)
