# Lifelong learning

Lifelong learning is the "ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated" pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. It is important for an individual's competitiveness and employability, but also enhances social inclusion, active citizenship, and personal development. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning))

This repository is heavily inspired by [this tremendous resource](https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing). I used to have all this stuff in my notes but now I want to try out repository so it's easily shareable and I can see the learning path from commit history üòÅ
